      <h3>Research data</h3>
      <p>Condense has a breadth of experience across the research data management.</p>
      <p>
        After going to the <a href='http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/'>eResearch conference</a> we decided it was time to pull together a portfolio of the work Condense has done in the Research data space.
        We've been working in the space for over 7 years now.
      </p>
      <p>Our experience includes engagements to develop strategies, designing solutions, developing data capture applications, managing data publishing services, business process and data analysis work.</p>
      <p>Here's our <a href="/assets/pdfs/condense-research-data-portfolio-2019.pdf">Research Data Portfolio</a>.</p>

      <h3>Asset management</h3>
      <p>Condense has deep experience in the asset management space.</p>
      <p>We have delivered numerous <b>applications</b> covering a wide range of facilities management functions, including the Work Requests system and contractor login, Project Management Register, the Asset Register, Planned Maintenance, Security Incident Management, and emissions data reporting.</p>
      <p>We have <b>integrated</b> with other systems including the Tech 1 for project budget management and Purchase Now for enterprise procure-to-pay workflow. </p>
      <p>On-the-go field access, already a major use case through <b>responsive web applications</b>, has just been significantly improved with the launch of a <b>native mobile application</b>.</p>
      <p>A core factor of this transformation has been careful <b>analysis</b> and <b>designing</b> applications with the web in mind.</p>
      <p>The success of these projects has led to significantly improved data capture and workflow compliance across all areas of the business.</p>
