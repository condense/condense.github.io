            <h4>Research data management</h4>
            <p>Condense has a breadth of experience across the research data management working with tertiary
                institutions and government clients.</p>
            <p>
                After going to the <a href='http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/'>eResearch conference</a> we decided it
                was time to pull together a portfolio of the work we've done in the Research data space.
                We've been working in the space for over 7 years now.
            </p>
            <p>Our experience includes engagements to develop strategies, designing solutions, developing data capture
                applications, managing data publishing services, business process and data analysis work.</p>
            <p>Here's our <a href="/assets/pdfs/condense-research-data-portfolio-2019.pdf">Research Data Portfolio</a>.

            <h4>Asset management</h4>
            <p>Condense has deep experience in the asset management space.</p>
            <p>We have delivered numerous applications covering a wide range of facilities management functions,
                including the Work Requests system and contractor login, Project Management Register, the Asset
                Register, Planned Maintenance, Security Incident Management, and emissions data reporting.</p>
            <p>We have integrated with other systems including the Tech 1 for project budget management and
                Purchase Now for enterprise procure-to-pay workflow. </p>
            <p>On-the-go field access, already a major use case through responsive web applications, has just
                been significantly improved with the launch of a native mobile application.</p>
            <p>A core factor of this transformation has been careful analysis and designing applications
                with the web in mind.</p>
            <p>The success of these projects has led to significantly improved data capture and workflow compliance
                across all areas of the business.</p>
