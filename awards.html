        <b>iAward Big Data Innovation of the Year</b><br/>
        2018 Tasmania iAwards<br/>
        Seamap Australia<br/>
        In partnership with Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS)<br/>
        <br/>
        For solutions which use large volumes of data (both structured and unstructured) resulting in real strategic analysis and better decisions.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>

          This project shows how large volumes of data from a variety of sources and classification practices
          can be turned into a coherent national dataset which is accessible to key decision makers.

          When users can overlay 3rd party data sources across other dimensions of structured and unstructured data, you can produce "big picture" insights.

        <b>iAward Public Sector and Government Markets</b><br/>
        2018 Tasmania iAwards<br/>
        Seamap Australia<br/>
        In partnership with Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS)<br/>
        <br/>
        Digital projects that deliver the digitisation of citizen services and improve efficiencies in the machinery of Government.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
              Seamap Australia shows the value in providing access to the treasure trove of data captured by scientists and researchers.
              Working with large organisations in the public sector requires an understanding of the sometimes-complex environment and the difficulties in manipulating different sources for large amounts of data to achieve meaningful results.
              This success is based on a close working partnership with IMAS.
