          This initiative is a great example of how large volumes of data from a variety of sources and classification practices
          into a coherant national dataset which is accessible to key decision makers.


          By allowing users overlay 3rd party data sources other dimensions of structured and unstructured data can be used
          to produce "big picture" insights.

        2018 Tasmania iAwards<br/>

        In partnership with Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS)<br/>

        Digital projects that deliver the digitisation of citizen services and improve efficiencies in the machinery of Government.

        <blockquote>
            <p>

      Seamap Australia shows the value that can be unlocked by providing access to the treasuretrove of data captured
      by scietists and researchers.

      Working with large organisations in the public sector requires an understanding of the sometimes-
      complex environment and the difficulties of manipulating different sources for large amounts of
      data to achieve meaningful results.

      This close partnership has yielded meaningful results.
