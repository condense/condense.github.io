Data isn't the only thing that excites us; food and travel do too!  We
both took lengthy trips before starting [Condense](/), and one of the
many memorable food experiences I had was at a trendy noodle bar in
New York called [Momofuku](http://momofuku.com/new-york/noodle-bar/).

It was so good I ate there twice, and then bought
[the book](http://www.amazon.com/Momofuku-David-Chang/dp/030745195X/)
when I returned home.  Coincidentally there is a business term
["ramen-profitable"](http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html),
usually applied to startups but applicable to any new business,
meaning the point at which you have enough income to be
self-sustaining (that is, you can feed yourself, even if it's just
cheap instant ramen).  This felt appropriate for us, and I resolved
that when [Condense](/) hit this point I would recreate the Momofuku
ramen!

The celebration took place, a little late, this past weekend.  It
involved broth
[simmered for 6 hours](http://foodnwhine.com/2013/01/08/momofuku-ramen-broth/),
just-poached egg (cooked in the shell for 45 minutes at 60&deg;C),
slow-cooked pork-belly, and so on.  The only thing not created from
scratch, according to the recipe, was the noodles---none the less it
was a glorious celebration of how far we've come in a short time, and
we can't wait for the next milestone!
