Well it didn't take long—our blog has already gone quiet but there are two very good reasons.   Firstly, we're busy with client work which is fantastic.  Secondly, and perhaps more telling, is that our clients want to protect their competitive advantage which makes it hard to talk directly about our work.

We expected that our data-oriented projects were going to be commercially sensitive—after all, an information gap can give business an edge over the competition.

Of course, success in business is about more than just knowing more than the opposition.   It's about establishing systems, processes, infrastructure, partnerships and a track record which influences buyer behaviour and delivers a better overall customer experience.

We think that effective business data-use underpins all of these factors.

NPR's Planet Money do some great radio articles on the use of data in business; "[From Harvard Economist To Casino CEO](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/11/15/142366953/the-tuesday-podcast-from-harvard-economist-to-casino-ceo)" is an absolute classic.  This next generation CEO has a very data oriented mantra: "three things that can get you fired from Caesars: Stealing, sexual harassment and running an experiment without a control group."  It's 20 minutes long and a real eye opener.

From our perspective it's all quite exciting.  We have found that our positioning as software developers with data analytics specialisation is valued and our early clients are all helping to build our portfolio (stay tuned) and skills through relevant project work.
