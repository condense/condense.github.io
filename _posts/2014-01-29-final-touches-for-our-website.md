It's late January and we are putting final touches on our website.  No doubt it will involve overtime but for now we're quite proud of the structure.

Let me take you on a quick tour.

Right now you're in the ["thinking" section](/thinking.html) this is where you'll discover what we're actively taking interest in.  The blog will include synthesis and opinion alongside other fresh content related to our industry.  We straddle several spheres so not all articles will appeal - we plan evolve a few key subcategories to let people tuning topics of interest.

Within the thinking section we've included active [research interests](/thinking/research.html).  These are things which push the envelope for us and help us grow as a business.  If you see something of interested there please get in touch.

The final tab is ["inspiration"](/inspiration.html) where we link out to articles and quotes from around the world which relate to the data-driven revolution.  It is primarily focused on bubbling up interesting data-points and less about our commentary.

The other content is much as you would expect from a consulting company.  Just enough information to make you want to call us!
