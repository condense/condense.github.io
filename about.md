## Our Motivation

Condense was born from a simple observation. A revolution is sweeping the business world. Big businesses are profiting from business intelligence: leveraging data-driven insights and action to grow and thrive. So, why don't small businesses take advantage of data insight? The reality is, these technologies are applicable right now; you just need the know-how. We combine experience in engineering, research, marketing and strategy to bring these technologies to your business and bottom-line.
