<p class="lead">
  We're a creative team who strive to develop innovative new products. Research projects are an exciting opportunity for you to gain from our industry leadership initiatives.
</p>

<p>We work closely with industry to build strong and enduring relationships so we can work together to explore and solve important problems.</p>

<p>Our research projects are a great opportunity for businesses to push the envelope and pilot new initiatives in a low risk way.</p>

<p>Research projects are how we take on strategically important work that can't be delivered in a standard consulting situation, given the higher levels of uncertainty involved.</p>

<p>In research projects we apply our expertise in new or novel ways with the aim of building new tools and processes to deliver outstanding results. This stands in contrast to our standard consulting engagements where we apply our expertise and established processes to deliver proven results.</p>

<p>Currently we're exploring these research areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="personalisation.html">Personalised customer experience</a></li>
  <li><a href="data-culture.html">Data-driven culture</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Talk to us about how our research projects can benefit you.</p>
