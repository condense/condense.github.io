We're a creative team who strive to develop innovative new products but this can't happen in a vacuum. We work closely with industry to build strong and enduring relationships so we can work with them to explore and solve important problems.

These research projects are a great opportunity for businesses to push the envelope and pilot new initiatives in a low risk way.

Research projects are how we take on strategically important work which can't be delivered in a standard consulting situation given the higher levels of uncertainty involved.

In research projects we apply our expertise in new or novel ways with the aim of building new tools and processes which can deliver results. This stands in contrast to our standard consulting engagements where we apply our expertise and established processes to deliver proven results.

An important outcome of this work for us is to be able to talk about the results. We ask our project partners permission to share our successes---with sensitivity to any commercially sensitive aspects.

Currently we're exploring these research areas:

* [Personalised customer experience](personalisation.html)
* [Data-driven culture](data-culture.html)

Please get in touch if you would like to discuss or, perhaps, work with us on a research project.
