<p class="lead">Modern machine learning techniques have opened the door for businesses to provide a more personalised service.</p>

<p>We can see this with industry leaders like Coles providing personalised discounts as part of loyalty programs, Amazon offering personalised product recommendations, and Tescos who stock every store differently to suit their customer needs.</p>

<p>By analysing past sales data and customer information you have the opportunity to provide a better service which encourages loyalty and drives customer spending patterns.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re interested in working with consumer retail and online businesses who believe that mining their operational databases could improve sales and repeat business.</p>
