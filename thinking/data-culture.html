<p>Industry reports show that businesses who effectively leverage data
  outperform their competition but the journey to a data-driven culture
  is challenging.</p>

<p>According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, these businesses <i>"are
  integrating data into their day-to-day operations. They are placing
  data at the heart of almost all important decisions. They are
  tolerant of question&mdash;even dissent&mdash;about business
  decisions being made, as long as the questioning is based on data
  and their analysis."</i></p>

<p>But moving to a data-driven culture is challenging. Executives may be
  reluctant to turn over decision-making to people who make decisions on the
  basis of data rather than expertise, concerns about privacy and security may
  limit data access, and business units may be reluctant to share data.</p>

<p>Even with systems and a supportive culture you need staff with the
  analytical skills required to take advantage of the data, and managers who
  know how to use the analysis to make effective decisions. Both skills could
  become scarce if reports are to be believed.</p>

<p>We understand that this is a very real challenge for businesses and it is
  something we have been researching. We are interested to meet and discuss
  with managers who are experiencing these difficulties and to help them work
  towards a more data-driven culture.</p>
